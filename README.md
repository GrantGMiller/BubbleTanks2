This is an open source fan-made remake of Bubble Tanks 2 I'm writing fully in Python/Pygame. <br>

## Description

Bubble Tanks 2 is an open world top-down fighting game where you must travel through giant bubbles, destroying enemy tanks and taking their bubbles to fuel your growth. As you grow, you constantly evolve and get ever better weapons. Ultimately, you'll have to face the ultimate adversary and defeat it to win the game.

## Why?
I've been learning Python and to make the process more fun, I decided to make a small game in Pygame.
Since I really enjoyed playing Bubble Tanks 2 as a child, I decided to try to make a clone of this game from scratch. The fact that Bubble Tanks 2 was running on Flash Player, which is no longer supported, was another incentive for me to make a remake independent of this technology.
Also, the game has some cool mechanics that I would be very interested in trying to program.
