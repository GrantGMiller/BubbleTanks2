This is a remastered version of an old flash game "Bubble Tanks 2", made with Python/Pygame.
I'm making it for 3 reasons:
	- to improve my knowledge of Python, OOP and game development
	- to be able to play this amazing game, even despite the fact that Flash Player is no longer supported
	- this is a lot of fun! :)

The game is not finished yet, still a lot of things to do.

To start the game run "__main__.py"

For any questions, suggests etc you can write to ildar.239@mail.ru
