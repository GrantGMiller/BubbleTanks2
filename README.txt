This is a remastered version of an old flash game "Bubble Tanks 2", made in Python using Pygame.
I'm making it for 3 reasons:
	- to improve my programming skills
	- to be able to play this amazing game, even despite the fact that Flash Player is no longer supported
	- This is a lot of fun! :)

This project is open source, work is still in progress, a lot of things to do.

To start the game run "__main__.py"
To make an executable file run command "pyinstaller setup.spec"

For any questions, suggests etc you can write to ildar.239@mail.ru
